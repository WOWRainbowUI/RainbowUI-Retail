What is VuhDo?

VuhDo is a raid monitor similar to CTRaidAssist or Blizzards built-in raid frames. Basically this is about displaying the health of raid members in form of clearly arranged bars. VuhDo is primarily directed to healing classes, but will make use to almost any other class. Moreover several healing spells or other actions can be asserted to mouse clicks on those bars (Click-Heal).

What VuhDo can do: 
1. Display all relevant informations about your raid members

3. Set up the raid

Below we have archived the parting message from Iza @ EU-Gilneas, the original creator of this amazing addon:
> 2014-04-25: I (Iza) am sorry to announce that I'm not
> going to further develop or maintain VuhDo anymore.
> 
> I haven't been actively playing wow for some years
> now and lately - as you might have noticed - 
> my efforts (and also interest) in maintaining and 
> developing WoW addons tends to zero, so I'll be
> gone for good I guess.
> 
> Thanks to a fine community for the great times 
> and for sharing all the uncounted ideas and suggestions 
> which finally have made VuhDo what I believe is a decent 
> addon.

> All the best to you & keep it going,
