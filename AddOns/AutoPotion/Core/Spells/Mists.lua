-- Directly confirmed against Mists of Pandaria Classic on Wowhead: these ids still
-- resolve to the class ham.<name> already implies (the earlier "shared with Priest"
-- reading on giftOfTheNaaruMonk turned out to be a search-result artifact - checked
-- again directly and it cleanly requires Monk on MoP Classic).

-- One row for "Gift of the Naaru" instead of one per class - Rogue isn't playable

-- ham.darkPact (108416): the OLD "Dark Pact" (drained the Warlock's own pet's mana) was
-- removed in the Cata 4.0.1 pre-patch and never came back. This id is a different,
-- unrelated talent that launched in patch 5.0.4 (MoP) called "Sacrificial Pact" -
-- sacrifice your demon (or yourself, with none out) for a shield. It kept the same id
-- when Blizzard renamed it to "Dark Pact" in Legion 7.0.3, so this IS the right id for
-- MoP Classic, it'll just display/tooltip as "Sacrificial Pact" there (the client's own
-- period-correct name), not as a wrong or unrelated spell.
table.insert(ham.supportedSpells, ham.darkPact)

-- NOT added here even though Monk exists by MoP - confirmed these specific ids do NOT
-- carry over to MoP Classic, so adding them would show the wrong spell:
-- ham.expelHarm (322101) - MoP Classic's Expel Harm is a different id (115072)
-- ham.healingElixir (122281) - MoP Classic's version is a different id (122280) with a
--   different effect (proc-based "Healing Elixirs", not a drink-a-flask activated spell)

-- More Mists-only spells go here. Either add a spell already created in
-- Core/Spells.lua to the settings list for this flavor:
-- table.insert(ham.supportedSpells, ham.someSpellFromTheBaseFile)
-- ...or create and add one that's exclusive to this flavor:
-- ham.someMistsOnlySpell = ham.Spell.new(123456, "WARRIOR") -- class token, or omit for non-class spells
-- table.insert(ham.supportedSpells, ham.someMistsOnlySpell)
