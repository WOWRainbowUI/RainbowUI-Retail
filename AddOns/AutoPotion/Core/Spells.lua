-- Racials WTF These are all seperate Spells. Each keeps its real class tag (needed so

-- name) but none of them are inserted into ham.supportedSpells individually - per-flavor
-- files bundle the ones valid for that flavor into a single ham.SpellGroup instead, so

-- class variant.

-- NOTE: every ham.xxx spell object above is always created, regardless of flavor -
-- Core/DB.lua and code.lua reference some of these globals unconditionally (e.g.
-- ham.recuperate.getId()), so removing the object itself on non-retail flavors would
-- crash the addon there. What varies per flavor is only which spells are *offered* in
-- the settings UI, via membership in ham.supportedSpells below.
--
-- Only spells confirmed available since Classic Era go in the shared list here; every
-- other spell here today (Legion/Cata/MoP/Dragonflight+ abilities, classes that don't
-- exist pre-Wrath/pre-Mists, retail-only racials) is added to ham.supportedSpells from
-- Core/Spells/Retail.lua instead, so Classic/TBC/Wrath/Cata/Mists don't list spells
-- their client can't actually cast. Add spells to the matching Core/Spells/<Flavor>.lua
-- file as their real per-flavor availability gets verified.
