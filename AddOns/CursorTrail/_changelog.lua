=======================================
RELEASE 11.0.2.7
Released 2024-10-13

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Version 11.0.2.7 for Retail WoW
Version 4.4.0.15 for Classic Cataclysm
Version 1.15.4.2 for Classic WoW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
NEW FEATURES:
- Save the position of the main window between reloads.

- Scroll bar buttons in popup menus will flash if there are more lines above/below those being shown.  They will also auto-repeat when held down.

- Right-clicking the colorswatch square will now switch between its current color and white (or red if the current color is white).

- Added new shapes:
        Bug (Blue)
        Bug (Orange)
        Frame (Gold)
        Frame (Gold 3D)
        Glow (Gold)
        Glyph (Green)
        Ring (Atramedes)
        Ring (Bronze)
        Ring (Eclipse)
        Ring (Gear)
        Ring (Gold)
        Ring (Horde)
        Ring (Ice)
        Ring (Meat)
        Ring (Orange)
        Ring (Reticle)
        Ring (Spotted)
        Ring (Stone)
        Ring (Stone 2)
        Shield (Alliance)
        Shield (Gold)

- Added new defaults:
        Evil Eye
        Ice Cold  ...  Not available in Classic (Vanilla) WoW.

CHANGES:
- Reversed the order of choices for "Layer Strata", so the topmost strata level is at the top of the list of choices, and moving the mousewheel up to change the selection "moves the strata level up".  (And vice-versa.)

- No longer automatically create a backup named "@v11.0.2.3".  (It was only a temporary safety measure and is no longer needed.)

- Increased the size of text in dropdown menus.

- Editboxes are slightly taller, making them easier to click.

- Increased the amount a value changes when using the mouse wheel for the following settings.  (Up/down keys still change them by 1.)
            Shadow (%) - Changes by 5 each time.
            Opacity (%) - Changes by 5 each time.
            Scale (%) - Changes by 2 each time.

- Optimized memory usage, reducing the amount of memory used when the UI opens.  (Now, an "undo" copy of all profiles is made only when a profile is modified.  Changing UI settings without saving no longer increases memory significantly.)

- Changed Help and Changelog icon buttons behavior.  Clicking them now shows and hides their corresponding windows.

- If both Help and Changelog are shown at same time, their windows will be positioned side-by-side.

- Updated code for scrolling through dropdown items with the mouse wheel while the menu is closed.  (No noticeable change.)

- Simplified code for how shapes and shadows follow the mouse position.  (No noticeable change.)

- Changed code for how shape sizes are set, so shapes whose width is different than their height can be properly displayed.  (No noticeable change.)

- Changed the color of Layer 2's shape to white for the default named "(Start Here)".  (Many of the new shapes require white to look their best.)

BUG FIXES:
- When changing shapes while "fade out" is on, the new shape now appears briefly.

- Fixed problem where the second layer's shape didn't show up immediately after loading a profile that had two shapes and the previous profile only had one.  This would only happen one time after a reload.  (BUG_20240930.1)

- Fixed problems with the "right-click swap between default values" feature.

- Fixed a bug when clicking the small up/down arrows at the top of Load and Defaults popup lists.  (The previous/next item failed to load the first time the listbox had to scroll the item into view.)

- Fixed missing warning message that asks about saving a modified default profile before loading a different profile.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Version 11.0.2.7 for Retail WoW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        Frame (Stormy, Yellow)

        Flashy Ball Bearing

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

        Soul Skull Trail
        Ring & Soul Skull
        Small Blue Green
        Sphere Orange Swirl

RELEASE 11.0.2.6
Released 2024-09-27

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Version 11.0.2.6 for Retail WoW
Version 4.4.0.14 for Classic Cataclysm
Version 1.15.4.1 for Classic WoW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
NEW FEATURES:
- Added a new profile option: "Use same profile for all characters".  When on, a small icon appears near the upper-left corner of the profile name, and that profile will be used for all characters rather than have different profiles for each character.
Note: To open profile options, click "Menu" in the main window and select "Profile Options", or type "/ct pow".

- Added slash command:
        /ct pow    (Shows/Hides the profile options window.)

- Added "Undo" to the Menu dropdown list.  It undoes unsaved changes to the current profile.  (Same as reloading the profile.)

- Added "Reset Layer" to the context menu that appears when right-clicking an empty area of the main window's background.

CHANGES:
- Added shortcut keys to Yes/No popup messages.  Pressing the Y key triggers the Yes button, and N key triggers the No button.

- When loading default profiles, many of them will keep your current settings for "Show only in combat" and "Show during Mouse Look", unless those settings are an important part of the profile's design.

- Updated the "Ring & Rainbow" default.  (Retail WoW only.)

- The profile options window can now be moved.

- Rewrote the code for displaying many of the popup messages.  (Should be no noticeable differences.)

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed bug where popup messages could be permanently covered up simply by clicking on the main UI while a message was being displayed.

- Fixed tab key cycling through editboxes.  It no longer does anything on disabled layers.

- Fixed minor bugs involving undoing changes to profiles after they were saved.  (BUG_20240925.1 and BUG_20240925.2)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Version 1.15.4.1 for Classic WoW

NEW FEATURES:
- Added a second layer, making it possible to have two models, two shapes, two shadows, or any combination of them.
Note: If you have at least one saved profile, a backup named "@v11.0.2.3" is created to ensure your old profiles will not be lost during the conversion to the new layers format.  (Can be restored by clicking "Menu" and selecting "Restore..." from the dropdown list.)

- Added a context menu for selecting and enabling layers.  (To open the menu, right-click an empty area of the option window's background.)

            "(Start Here)"  ...  This is a good starting point for a new profile.

            "Fireball"  ...  Available in Retail WoW only.

- Changelog button now flashes when there is new information that has not been seen yet.  (Flashing always stops after next reload.)

- Checkboxes can be toggled on/off by clicking their text as well as their box.
Note: Classic WoW checkboxes already work this way.

CHANGES:

- Added a memory check when combat ends.  It prints a warning if CursorTrail's memory usage ever grows too large.

        /ct screen

        /ct model
        /ct camera

- Added diagnostic command to help diagnose large frame rate drops on some computers.

- Add new models to all versions.
- Added new default: "Glowing Star, Red".
- Added color-coded model categories, making it easier to see the different categories in the Model dropdown list.

- Right-clicking most of the options will now set them to their default value.
- Added a "Tips" section to the help window.

  * IMPORTANT - You may need to adjust your profiles that have model offsets that are not zero.  (Sorry.)
- Fixed dropdown menus so they close if the mouse wheel is used over the text box part of the dropdown (to cycle through items).
- Fixed bug that incorrectly changed the position of cursor FX when scale % was changed using arrow keys.
- Implemented a potential fix for problems seen on ultrawide monitors. (Handled the DISPLAY_SIZE_CHANGED event.)
- Improved the "/ct reset" slash command so it can recover from more serious errors.
- Updated the UI controls and profiles libraries.

- Automatically create a backup of your current profiles everytime you log into the game (named "@Login").

- Fixed color swatch button sometimes showing wrong color after "Sparkle" checkbox was turned off.

- Changed color picker implementation so the custom color palette only appears for CursorTrail.  All other addons and system options will use the original color picker.  (Prevents future Blizzard color picker design changes from being covered up by the CursorTrail custom color palette.)
- Fixed errors caused by calling the SetPropagateKeyboardInput() function during combat.
- Clicking outside of an open dropdown menu will now close that menu.
- Updated the UI controls library.  (Should not cause any noticeable changes.)
