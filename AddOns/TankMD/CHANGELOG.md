## [v3.2.0](https://github.com/Oppzippy/TankMD/tree/v3.2.0) (2024-08-18)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Oppzippy/TankMD/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Oppzippy/TankMD/releases)

- Remove luacheck  
    The primary reason for using luacheck was checking for typos in variable  
    names and such. luals covers that and much more, so it is now obsolete  
    for the purposes of this addon.  
- Configure the actionbutton to always run on down  
    Closes GH-18
