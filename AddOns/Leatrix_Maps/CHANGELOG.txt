10.0.08 - 8th November 2022
- Due to problems with Blizzard's code in Dragonflight, the '/ltm' slash command has been removed for the time being.  As a workaround, you can enter '/run leamaps()' to open Leatrix Maps.  If you want to pass a parameter, enter it in quotes between the brackets.  Example: /run leamaps("wipe").  This (hopefully temporary) change is necessary because of a bug in the game code with the slash command system.  Entering any addon related slash command will taint the UI and cause errors to show at some point.  Blizzard are aware of the bug.  When they fix it, the /ltm slash command will return.  You can assign a hotkey to open Leatrix Maps in the game keybindings panel and you can open Leatrix Maps using the minimap button if it's enabled in the Leatrix Maps configuration panel so there are plenty of options.

Click the reload button to clear the error.  Enable Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) on your game account to avoid seeing this error.  If you don't have Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) enabled on your game account, an advisory alert button will be shown in the configuration panel.
- If you use premade group finder, you can no longer change the same faction only setting after you have listed the group.  You need to delist the group to change the same faction only setting.
- Various taint fixes.  Added a help button to the zoom heading to notify that enabling any of the zoom settings will taint the map (if you use other map addons such as HandyNotes or TomTom, they will taint the map anyway regardless of the zoom settings).

9.2.18 - 6th July 2022
- If 'Remove map border' is enabled, the map close and maximise/minimise buttons will now be shown on the right-side of the map.

-- Ensure Leatrix Maps does not replace LeaMapsDB on next reload
SlashCmdList["Leatrix_Maps"]("nosave")
-- Clear the settings database (optional but recommended)
wipe(LeaMapsDB)
-- Configure the settings (add any settings you like here)
LeaMapsDB["NoMapBorder"] = "On"
-- Reload the UI to apply the settings
ReloadUI()
