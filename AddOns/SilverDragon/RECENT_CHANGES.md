## Changed in v2026.12

* Undermine: add the vignette rewards for S.C.R.A.P. Heaps
* Dragonflight: remove duplicated requirement notice for Verdant Skitterfly
* Delay the first vignette scan when logging in slightly so we'll have location data
* Overlay: Improve adding of data to Blizzard's map pins
* RangeExtender will no longer clutter up your addon list if you're not in a game-type that supports it
