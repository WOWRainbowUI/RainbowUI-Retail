## Changed in v2026.8

* If you're in Midnight, and your preferences for message announcements would be sending them to Blizzard's floating combat text, this is being forcibly changed so they go to the UIErrorsFrame instead, as new taint issues mean that any addon use of Blizzard's system makes it stop working for regular combat messages.
