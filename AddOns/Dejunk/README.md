# Dejunk

Dejunk is an addon for automating some tedious aspects of selling and
destroying items.

By default, all poor quality items are considered junk items (this setting can
be turned off). Higher quality items must be manually added to an `Inclusions`
list in order to mark them as junk.

Once set up, Dejunk can handle the process of selling or destroying junk items
with the press of a button.
