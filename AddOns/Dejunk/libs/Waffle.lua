--- Shared by every node in the tree, root included.
--- @class WaffleFlexNode
--- @field frame? WaffleFrame Cannot be given together with `frameFactory`. Not changeable after construction.
--- @field frameFactory? fun(parent: WaffleFrame): WaffleFrame Cannot be given together with `frame`. `parent` is `nil` for the root, nothing sits above it to pass in. Not changeable after construction.
--- @field defaultFrameFactory? fun(parent: WaffleFrame): WaffleFrame Applies to descendants only, not this node itself.
--- @field children? WaffleFlexNode[] Positioned in a row or column, per `direction`.
--- @field direction? WaffleFlexDirection Default `ROW`. `_REVERSE` keeps the same main axis, only the starting edge (and visual order along it) flips. Case insensitive, any other value throws an error.
--- @field width? integer | "AUTO" | string Always physical/horizontal, regardless of `direction`. `"AUTO"` sums this node's own children's own `width` along its main axis (`direction` is `ROW`), maxes them along its cross axis instead. `"AUTO"` on a node with `wrap` (`direction` `COLUMN`) counts the lines its height produces instead, including a height it is stretched to or gets as a flexible node. A percentage string (`"50%"`) resolves against the parent's own `width`, erroring without one available (the root, or a parent whose own `width` is itself still being computed from `"AUTO"`). Has no effect on `minWidth`/`maxWidth`, same as any other fixed `width`.
--- @field height? integer | "AUTO" | string Same as `width`, vertical instead; sums along its main axis when `direction` is `COLUMN`, maxes along its cross axis otherwise, a percentage resolves against the parent's own `height`. `"AUTO"` on a node with `wrap` (`direction` `ROW`) counts the lines its width produces instead, including a width it is stretched to or gets as a flexible node.
--- @field grow? number This node's own share of its parent's leftover main-axis space, relative to its equally-flexible siblings. Default `1`. No effect on a node with its own explicit main-axis `width`/`height`, or on the root.
--- @field shrink? number This node's own share of its parent's main-axis deficit, when its siblings' own sizes don't all fit. Weighted by this value times this node's own main-axis size, not the value alone. Default `1`; `0` never shrinks below this node's own stated size. No effect on a flexible node (nothing stated to reduce), or on the root.
--- @field align? WaffleFlexAlign Cross-axis alignment for this node's own children. Default `STRETCH`. A child's own `alignSelf` overrides this. Case insensitive, any other value throws an error.
--- @field alignSelf? WaffleFlexAlign Overrides the parent's `align`. Requires this node's own cross-axis dimension if not `STRETCH`. No effect on the root. Case insensitive, any other value throws an error.
--- @field justify? WaffleFlexJustify Main-axis distribution of leftover space among this node's own children. Default `START`. No effect if any child has a positive `grow` share, it already claims the leftover space. Case insensitive, any other value throws an error.
--- @field wrap? boolean Overflowing children start a new line instead of continuing past the main axis size. Each line gets its own cross-size (a max over its own children) and stacks after the previous one, `lineGap` between lines too. Default `false`.
--- @field gap? integer Between children only, not the edges. Default `0`.
--- @field lineGap? integer Between wrapped lines only, instead of `gap`. No effect unless `wrap` actually produces more than one. Falls back to `gap` if unset.
--- @field padding? integer On all four sides. Default `0`. Overridden per side by `paddingTop`/`paddingRight`/`paddingBottom`/`paddingLeft`.
--- @field paddingTop? integer Overrides `padding` for the top side only.
--- @field paddingRight? integer Overrides `padding` for the right side only.
--- @field paddingBottom? integer Overrides `padding` for the bottom side only.
--- @field paddingLeft? integer Overrides `padding` for the left side only.
--- @field margin? integer Space around this node itself, on all four sides. Default `0`. Overridden per side by `marginTop`/`marginRight`/`marginBottom`/`marginLeft`.
--- @field marginTop? integer Overrides `margin` for the top side only.
--- @field marginRight? integer Overrides `margin` for the right side only.
--- @field marginBottom? integer Overrides `margin` for the bottom side only.
--- @field marginLeft? integer Overrides `margin` for the left side only.
--- @field minWidth? number A floor on this node's own `width`: the flexible main-axis share, if `width` is main; a `STRETCH`-ed cross-axis size, if cross. No effect on an explicit `width`, or `"AUTO"`. Errors if greater than `maxWidth`.
--- @field maxWidth? number A ceiling on this node's own `width`: the flexible main-axis share, if `width` is main; a `STRETCH`-ed cross-axis size, if cross. No effect on an explicit `width`, or `"AUTO"`. Errors if less than `minWidth`.
--- @field minHeight? number Same as `minWidth`, for `height`.
--- @field maxHeight? number Same as `maxWidth`, for `height`.
--- @field visibility? WaffleFlexVisibility `"VISIBLE"` shows this node's frame. `"INVISIBLE"` hides it but keeps its space in the layout, so siblings do not reflow. `"GONE"` excludes this node from the layout entirely; siblings reflow to fill the space, and `Layout()` hides its own frame and every already-resolved frame in its subtree. An ancestor's own `visibility` affects this node's frame the same way, without changing this node's own. On the root, `"INVISIBLE"` still creates its frame and lays out the tree, use `"GONE"` to defer that until it is first shown. Case insensitive, any other value throws an error. Default `"VISIBLE"`.
--- @field key? string For lookup via `FindByKey(key)`. Duplicate keys aren't validated against, the first match wins.
--- @field order? integer Visual position among siblings, independent of declaration order. Default `0`, ties broken by declaration order. No effect on the root.
--- @field onLayout? fun(frame: WaffleFrame, width: integer, height: integer) Fires once the whole `Layout()` pass is resolved and clean, not while it's still running, bottom-up, root last. Mutating a different node from here schedules a future `Layout()` call, the same as any other setter.
--- @field onMeasure? fun(frame: WaffleFrame, width?: number, height?: number): number, number Returns the content's `width, height` when this node leaves either `"AUTO"`. Called with the sizes already known: the axis being asked is `nil`, and so is the other one if it is not known yet. Only the `"AUTO"` axis of the result is used, and `shrink` still applies afterward. Cannot be given together with `children`. May run more than once per `Layout()` pass, so it must be safe to repeat. Never called for a `"GONE"` node.

--- Functions for resolving a node's own size along an axis (fixed,
--- percentage, or `"AUTO"`), and clamping a computed size to a node's
--- own `min`/`max`. `ResolveDimension` is the entry point. It sends
--- `"AUTO"` to `ComputeAutoMainSize` (sum of the children) along the
--- node's own main axis, and to `ComputeAutoCrossSize` (max of the
--- children, or of each wrapped line) along its cross axis. Splitting
--- children into wrapped lines (`SplitFlexLines`) and sharing a line's
--- main-axis space out (`ResolveLineSizes`) are sizing too, so they live
--- here, for computing `"AUTO"` sizes and for layout alike.
