Beta changes:
* Fixed a Lua error that occurred when opening options which hovering over a nameplate.
* Fixed a Lua error that occurred when hovering over a nameplate [Comment #7849]
* Fixed a bug that prevented any nameplates from being updated [Comment #7961].
* Hopefully fixed Lua errors that occurred because of accessing nameplates using unit tokens that are not allowed for this purpose (arenaN, bossN) [Comment #7944, #7939,# 7938, GH-654].
* Disabled HealerTracker widget because of BG scoreboard restrictions.
* Fixed a Lua error that occurred due to an error in the code for disabling off-tank detection for Midnight [Comment #7923, #7922, #7916, #7917, #7915].
* Disabled cast target in instances as UnitName returns secret values [Comment #7885].
* Disabled off-tank detection as UnitIsUnit returns secret values [Comment #7898].

* Fixed a Lua error that occurred when WoW events for protected nameplates were processed (e..g, friendy players in instances) [Comment #7870]
