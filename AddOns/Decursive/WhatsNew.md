Decursive 2.7.11 (2023-10-22)
-----------------------------

- TOC update for Wrath


Decursive 2.7.10 (2023-09-12)
-----------------------------

- Add support for Bleed Effects detection:
    - Decursive scans the debuffs with no type for particular keywords ('Physical' and 'Bleed' by default) in their description.
    - The debuffs are automatically added to a list the user can edit under the curing options
      (it is recommanded to review this list for non-English locales).

Many thanks to Teelolws for prototyping this solution and to Xadras for their
suggestions and follow-ups about the user editable list. Their contributions
made this solution possible.

Report any problem found with this new feature in [issue #248 on wowace.com](https://www.wowace.com/projects/decursive/issues/248).

- Decursive will remember the priority of types when the associated spells
  disappear as long as the user does not change the priorities.
  The default priorities are displayed in blue instead of green.
  As it is today active spells will always be put on top whenever the user
  changes the settings and lost abilities will be put at the end keeping their
  former order.

- Some layout changes in the MUFs option panel to make it more comfy.

- WoW Classic: Fix detection of Dispel Magic Rank 2 for Priests.
