In the 12.0.7 patch Blizzard introduced some code that was probably well-intentioned, but broke core unit frame and click-casting behaviour. As addon authors tried to fix these problems, in some cases those fixes ended up fighting with each other.",
        "The big change in Clique is that it now fully takes control of the frames that it manages. This means that if you want the default left-click (target) and right-click (menu) behaviour, you need to bind them in Clique or add those frames to the denylist. These actions are bound like this by default, but you may have removed them at some point.",
