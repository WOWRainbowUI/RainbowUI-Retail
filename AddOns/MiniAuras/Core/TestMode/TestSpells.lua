---Fills a container's slots with fake running-cooldown icons for the given test spells and

---up where it stopped. The one preview renderer: every module draws the same row of fake icons,
---differing only in which spells, where the row starts and how the icons are styled.
---Without an IconOverride, a spell whose texture cannot be resolved is skipped without
---leaving a gap.
---@param container IconSlotContainer
---@param spells table[]|number[] TestSpell entries, or bare spell ids.
---@param startSlot number First slot to write (after a kick icon, for the modules that show one).
---@param options table Styling and limits:
--- ReverseCooldown/HideIcon/HideSwipe/HideNumbers/ShowNumbers/Glow/FontScale passed through
--- to SetSlot;
--- Color tints every icon; ColorByDispelType tints each with its spell's DispelColor instead, or
--- with DispelColors[spellId] for a bare id, or round DispelPalette by slot for a spell in neither;
--- TextColor tints the countdown and any stand-in count, replacing the global colour-by-time
--- while it is set;
--- CenterStackText puts that text centred on each icon in place of the countdown (the icon
--- containers only, where the live displays can centre a stack count);
--- IconOverride draws that picture on every icon in place of the spell's own artwork;
--- ShowTooltips attaches each spell id;
--- Count caps how many spells are drawn (default all);
--- Repeat draws the list round again once it runs out, so Count is met rather than capped;
--- LeadCount marks how many entries at the head of the list stand in for a category leading the
--- row, which Repeat then comes round past;
--- Stagger staggers durations and start times so the swipes visibly differ (default a flat 15s);
--- BarTexture and Border are passed to a BarSlotContainer's fill and outline (the icon
--- containers ignore both, drawing their border off Color instead), and under ColorByDispelType
--- a bar keeps Color on its fill with the dispel colour on its outline alone;
--- SpellName false leaves a bar's fill unlabelled (default on).
