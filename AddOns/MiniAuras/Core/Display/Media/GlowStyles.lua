-- SetParent onto AuraButtons, so anything the 12.1 path cannot draw is left out.

-- Every style is static, and no animated one may come back. A REPEAT animation is evaluated every
-- frame even on a hidden icon, the containers create buttons far beyond the auras actually showing,
-- and there is no way to gate an animation per icon: AuraButtons forbid untrusted scripts, their
-- shown state is secret, and the frame count reports frames created rather than active.
--
-- Keys are user-facing db.GlowType values, and renaming one orphans saved configs.

-- A spec sets:
--   Texture/Atlas - the asset, exactly one of the two.
--   BlendMode     - texture blend mode.
--   Desaturated   - strip the asset's own colour so tints apply uniformly.
--   PaddingFactor - how far the overlay extends past the icon, as a multiple of its size.
