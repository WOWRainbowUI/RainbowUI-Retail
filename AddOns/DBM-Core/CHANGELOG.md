# DBM - Core

## [11.2.16](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/tree/11.2.16) (2025-09-16)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/compare/11.2.13...11.2.16) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/releases)

- prep new tag  
- Update localization.es.lua (#1764)  
- Update localization.br.lua (#1763)  
- Update localization.fr.lua (#1762)  
- Update localization.es.lua (#1761)  
- further clarify slash commands  
- bump alpha  
- remove support for wow interface. if they can't be bothered to keep site updated for patches anymore (or even entire game versions like mop), then it's time to stop bothering to keep addons up to date there  
- prep retag  
- Bugfixes;  
    - Make positioning cleaner on keystones frame (to always position topleft)  
    - Allow esc to close frames  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#1759)  
- Hide other panels when one opens.  
- ignore specIDs of 0 and recheck (when blizzard api gets buggy)  
- Also register for click AnyUp?  
- Remove bad debugging, derp.  
- bump alpha  
- scope button to only show on retail  
- Add missing GUI button for keystones  
- completely rearrange help slash command menus to be more constructive to modern times. 4 of the features in old help menu weren't even usuable in dungeons/raids anymore. Now /dbm help will provide list of actually useful commands and help2 will be where the more niche ones reside.  
    Caveat, many of translations may be wonkey because I just let copilot write em all for preliminary update. they'll likely get revised later
