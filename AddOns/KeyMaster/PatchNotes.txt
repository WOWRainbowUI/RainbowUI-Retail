--------------------------------------------------
Key Master v1.3.0-3
--------------------------------------------------
HOTFIX 1.3.3
- Fixed French clients having problems loading Key Master.

HOTFIX 1.3.1
- Fixed an error for new users of keymaster that would cause Key Master not to load properly.

Fixes (1.3.0):
- Fixed lua error when joining a party with someone that has a newer version of Key Master.

Updates:
- Due to drastic API changes - all character data is reset/removed on first load of 1.3.0. Log into each character to refresh.
- Changed data structure since mythic plus data no longer is kept by tran/fort criteria.
- Remapped UI elements on player and party frame to use newly created data structure.
- Added backward compatibility check to 1.2.5 and older to ignore data since structures are different.
- Changed player and party data frames to update when an score gained event happens from a mythic plus dungeon.
- Updated rating calculator on player frame for the new mythic plus rating system (Big thanks to OMGTOTEM's contribution!).
- Temporality changed the player frame to a new layout since tyran/fort is no longer a thing.
- Adjusted the "What's New" content for easier readability.

Known Bugs/Issues:
- Party members running an older version of KM may experience LUA errors when grouped with someone running 1.3.0 or greater. Ask them to update!

--------------------------------------------------
Key Master v1.2.5
--------------------------------------------------
Fixes:
- Fixed portals so they work properly if you already have it unlocked.
- Fixed character list cleanup to purge last seasons characters correctly.

Updates:
- Updated IT Localization

Known Bugs/Issues:
- Season 1 mythic plus ratings and other functions are being verified and may not be accurate on day one.  We will do our best to update ASAP.
- Mythic plus vaults may not update immediately when completing a dungeon.  For now just do /reloadui to see the update properly.
- Due to a tight timeline to fix several critical bugs, some language translations are not completed. We will be updating those ASAP.

Special Note:
- If you have any issues with the character list not function make sure you login to the character and logout one time.  If this doesn't work purge the characters on the config tab and relogging to each one.  If this doesn't work then please delete the file in your WTF folder: <GameInstallPath>\WTF\Account[ACCOUNT_NAME]\SavedVariables\KeyMaster.lua

--------------------------------------------------
Key Master v1.2.4
--------------------------------------------------

- Fixed scroll bar on character list, as it wasn't scrolling properly previously.
- Fixed lua errors while entering combat
- Fixed minor cosmetic UI changes related to season/expansion

Updates:
- Characters of any level will now show up in the character list, previously it was max level only.. but since Blizzard decided to change the max level before it was achievable we've decided it was easier to add a checkbox filter (in the config tab) and allow all characters to show up in the list.

Known Bugs/Issues:
- Season 1 mythic plus ratings and other functions are being verified and may not be accurate on day one.  We will do our best to update ASAP.
- Mythic plus vaults may not update immediately when completing a dungeon.  For now just do /reloadui to see the update properly.
- Due to a tight timeline to fix several critical bugs, some language translations are not completed. We will be updating those ASAP.

--------------------------------------------------
Updates:
- When you are a party member of the matchmaking group system: Looking for Raid (LFR),

--------------------------------------------------
Key Master v1.0.0

- Several UI enhancements.
- There are some changes to the rating system for Dragonflight Season 4. We have added
  preliminary calculation changes that will account for some changes but not all. Due to the somewhat
  complex and obscure nature of the rating system, there is a notice at the top of the
  addon that will display until we are confident that all DF S4 rating calculations are correctly
  displayed. Please visit our Discord https://discord.gg/bbMaUpfgn8 or GitHub 
  https://github.com/Puresyn/KeyMaster to report or check the status on any new or ongoing corrections.

  Key Master installed from the commonly used Open Raid library (if they have another

  information; at least, for the time being.
- Replaced "Key Master Not Detected!" text with an icon on the party frame for
  party members without Key Master installed.
- Fixed Key Master icon showing up as a "?" in the in-game AddOn List. Now shows correct icon.
