About:
Key Master is an addon developed for World of Warcraft players who are actively
involved in Mythic Plus content.  The goal of the addon is to provide a single
location to display the otherwise scattered detailed Mythic Plus information about
you and/or your party members.

While there are many future features in-mind for Key Master to expand its
usefulness, how far it may go and when that will happen is largely dependent on
its user base. So, if you find Key Master useful, make sure to give us feeedback
and tell your friends!
