- Updated 'Sell junk automatically' ('Automation') internal code.  Fixed an issue which caused the addon to attempt to sell junk to vendors that don't want to buy it.  Fixed an issue with 'Show vendor summary in chat' which caused no vendor summary to be shown (this was caused by changes to Blizzard's Dragonflight game code).

10.0.12 - 18th November 2022
- For 'Show player chain' ('Interface'), you can now choose a rare silver chain if you wish.
- The setting to disable Blizzard's NO QUALITY LOOT spam has been removed as Blizzard have finally removed their spam code from the game.

- Fixed an issue with the flare keybindings not working.
- Due to problems with Blizzard's code in Dragonflight, setting an addon related keybind during combat using Blizzard's built-in game keybindings menu will give you a taint error.

- For 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface'), repositioned instance difficulty banner slightly.
- Dragonflight includes a lot of API changes.  To make sure Leatrix Plus runs error-free, always use the latest release downloaded from CurseForge (app or website).  If you want to report an issue, there is a support link on leatrix.com.

10.0.09 - 8th November 2022
- Due to problems with Blizzard's code in Dragonflight, the '/ltp' slash command has been removed for the time being.  As a workaround, you can enter '/run leaplus()' to open Leatrix Plus.  If you want to pass a parameter, enter it in quotes between the brackets.  Example: /run leaplus("wipe").  This (hopefully temporary) change is necessary because of a bug in the game code with the slash command system.  Entering any addon related slash command will taint the UI and cause errors to show at some point.  Blizzard are aware of the bug.  When they fix it, the /ltp slash command will return.  You can assign a hotkey to open Leatrix Plus in the game keybindings panel and you can open Leatrix Plus using the minimap button if it's enabled in the Leatrix Plus settings menu so there are plenty of options.

10.0.08 - 7th November 2022
- The 'Fix Blizzard's NO QUALITY LOOT spam' setting (part of 'Faster auto loot') is now disabled by default.  If you use this setting, you will need to enable it again after installing this update.  If you use XLoot, the setting will now be locked out.  As a reminder (and this is noted in the setting tooltip), if you use a loot frame replacement addon, you may need to disable the 'Fix Blizzard's NO QUALITY LOOT spam' setting.

10.0.07 - 7th November 2022
- For 10.0.2 clients only (currently BETA), added zone, dungeon and main title music for Dragonflight.  There are now 1979 music tracks and 123 movies available in the addon.
- If you use the Glass addon, some chat settings will now be locked out of Leatrix Plus in order to ensure that the addon loads correctly.
- For addon authors, the enhanced minimap combined button frame now has a global reference of LeaPlusGlobalMinimapCombinedButtonFrame.

- The 'Faster auto loot' temporary fix now supports open loot window at mouse.

10.0.04 - 30th October 2022
- Fixed an issue with 'Restore chat messages' ('Chat') which may have caused a Lua error to show in BugSack when logging out.

10.0.03 - 29th October 2022
- The faster auto loot fix will no longer apply to ElvUI users.

10.0.02 - 28th October 2022
- Added a temporary fix for 'Faster auto loot' ('System') to prevent the game from spamming you with NO QUALITY LOOT messages.  This spamming issue is caused by the game code and is not caused by addons.  This fix will be removed if Blizzard removes the two lines of unnecessary game code that are the cause of the spamming.  As this fix is only temporary, open loot window at mouse is not supported.  Usually, faster looting is so quick that you won't even see a loot window.  But when you do, it will be anchored to the Edit Mode position.  You can change the position with Edit Mode if you wish.
- Added a new option 'Hide rested sleep' ('Frames') which will allow you to hide the player frame rested sleep animation so your character no longer looks to be sleeping while banking, chatting, dancing, jumping, fishing, trading, crafting and using the auction house.
- For 'Automate gossip' ('Automation'), gossip from Katy Stampwhistle (the toy and the npc) will now be skipped automatically.

10.0.01 - 27th October 2022
- For 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface'), there is a new setting to hide the addon menu (the compartment menu).  It's enabled by default.  The minimum cluster scale is now 50% (was 100%).

- Fixed an issue with 'Hide keybind text' and 'Hide macro text' ('Text') which caused them to not apply to bars 6, 7 and 8.

- Added a new option 'Manage vehicle' ('Frames') which will allow you to move and scale the vehicle seat indicator frame.

- The 'More font sizes' option ('Chat') has been replaced by 'Set chat font size'.
- The 'Manage frames', 'Manage buffs', 'Manage power bar', 'Manage focus', 'Hide gryphons', 'Hide bags and micro', 'Set field of view' and 'Save profession filters' options have all been removed as they are now included in the game.
- The 'Show character addons' option ('System') has been removed due to issues with the game code.
- Having ElvUI installed will no longer uncheck conflicting option checkboxes.  Conflicting option checkboxes will still be locked but they won't be unchecked.  So if a conflicting option checkbox was checked before installing ElvUI or before enabling a conflicting ElvUI module, it will still be checked after disabling ElvUI or disabling the conflicting ElvUI module.
- Removed Shadowlands legacy code.  This release is not compatible with Shadowlands.

- Dragonflight: Added a temporary fix for the vendoring bug with game version 10.0.2.45779.  This bug is nothing to do with Leatrix Plus but it's difficult to play without being able to vendor anything.

This is a Dragonflight compatible replacement for the 'More font sizes' option from Shadowlands.

- For 'Enhance tooltip' ('Interface'), if you use the setting to hide tooltips for world units during combat, you can now specify whether holding shift should override that setting or not.  Also updated locale code.

- Fixed an issue which caused the 'Razorwings' setting ('Mute game sounds' in 'System') to not mute the mount sounds.

9.1.35 - 22nd December 2021
- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.  Special thanks to tflo for providing valuable feedback and axelady for updating ZonePet with LibDBIcon.

9.1.34 - 18th December 2021
- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed an issue with TomCatTours non-standard minimap button.

9.1.33 - 17th December 2021
- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.

9.1.31 - 15th December 2021
- For 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface'), added a new setting to give you the choice of whether to show the new covenant button on the round minimap (it will always be shown on the square minimap regardless of this setting).  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.

9.1.30 - 11th December 2021
- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).
- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.

'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  The covenant button has been updated with a new texture.  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).

9.1.27 - 2nd December 2021
- Added 'Razorwings' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').
- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Fixed an issue which caused minimap instance difficulty icons to be positioned incorrectly.

9.1.26 - 2nd December 2021

The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.
- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.

- If 'Hide event toasts' ('Frames') is enabled and you want the Torghast floor summary to fade as soon as you have finished reading it, right-click any of the highlighted rows in the floor summary then move the pointer away from the floor summary.  The floor summary will start to fade instantly.
- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.

9.1.24 - 24th November 2021
- The 'Hide level-up display' ('Frames') option is now called 'Hide event toasts'.  The new option will not hide Torghast floor and instance completion toasts.

9.1.23 - 17th November 2021
- On the 'Social' page, you can now specify that guild members and members of your communities should be treated as friends for all of the options on the 'Social' page.  Previously, guild members were always treated as friends but now it's optional.

- Added a new option 'Easy mount special' ('System').  If enabled, you can press CTRL/SPACE to trigger your mount's special animation.  Also works with shapeshifted forms.
- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.
- The minimum delay and the default delay for 'Release in PvP' ('Automation') is now 0ms (was 200ms).
- If 'Manage frames' ('Frames') is enabled, a temporary fix has been added for the game bug introduced in patch 9.1.5 which causes the player frame to reset when entering or exiting a vehicle.  The temporary fix will attempt to restore the player frame to your chosen location when you enter or exit a vahicle.  If you are in combat, the frame position will be restored when you leave combat.  This temporary fix will be removed once Blizzard fixes the bug in the game code.  The bug itself is not caused by addons.

All require a player target.  The nude and tabard buttons will apply to the currently showing model (either your character or your target).  Transformations such as shapeshift or appearance change toys will be removed.  The 'Reset' button will set the model back to your character.  All of the dressup window buttons are now much smaller and have tooltips.
