## [4.2](https://github.com/ZelionGG/XIV_Databar-Continued/releases/tag/4.2) (2026-02-12)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ZelionGG/XIV_Databar-Continued/compare/v4.1.1...v4.2) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/ZelionGG/XIV_Databar-Continued/releases)

### _Global :_

- 🚨 _**IMPORTANT** :_ The **Currency** module went into a big overhaul to allow you to only show an icon that will show a tooltip with all selected currencies in the module settings. Please note that checking the **Show more Currencies on Shift+Hover** will allow you to see X (X being the number of currencies in the module settings) currencies in the tooltip, the hard limit being 50 for visual reasons. As always, don't hesitate to send your feedbacks.
- 🆕 _**NEW** :_ Added options to hide each of the **Travel** module's button individually.
- 🛠️ _**IMPROVEMENT** :_ The **Travel** module went into a small overhaul again to optimize items/spells/toys names retrieval.
- 🛠️ _**IMPROVEMENT** :_ Updated German translation (thank you [DlargeX](https://github.com/DlargeX)).
- 🛠️ _**IMPROVEMENT** :_ Updated for patch **12.0.1**.

### _Retail :_

- 🆕 _**NEW** :_ Added an option to hide the **M+ Teleports** text in the **Travel** module.
- 🛠️ _**IMPROVEMENT** :_ The **Micromenu** module went into a big overhaul to make most buttons compliant with SecureActionButtonTemplate (making LUA errors **ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED** not likely to happen again).

### _Classic :_

- 🛠️ _**IMPROVEMENT** :_ The **Micromenu** module is now mostly synced with the Retail version.
