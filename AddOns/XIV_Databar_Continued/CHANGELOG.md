### _Global :_

- Brought back the **Bar Color** and **Bar alpha** options in the general settings.
- Fixed a LUA error happening with the **Clock** module.

### _Retail :_

- The **Micromenu** module went into an overhaul to fix multiple Taint (Action blocked) issues. It's now possible to use most of the buttons in combat (Spellbook and Talents are still locked in combat).
- Fixed **M+ Teleports** not working when the **ActionButtonUseKeyDown** CVar was not in the correct state.
