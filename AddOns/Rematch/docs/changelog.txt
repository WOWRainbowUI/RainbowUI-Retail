Notes:
- Items or spells dragged from the Rematch toolbar will not inherit any extra functionality from the Rematch toolbar, such as not wasting a cooldown/bandage if pets are already healed, or taking off the Safari Hat if it's already on. You are picking up the actual item or spell as defined by Blizzard and not Rematch's implementation of it.
- If your ActionButtonUseKeyDown cvar is enabled (so action buttons trigger on key down rather than key up), dragging an item or spell off the toolbar will also attempt to use it. This is a consequence of secure button behavior changes by Blizzard.

11/07/2023 version 5.0.0
Rematch 5 is an entirely new version of Rematch, rewritten from the ground up. There are many (many) changes, not all listed here, but some highlights include:

General UI:
- A more polished and consistent UI using modern elements like scrollboxes and views, while keeping a familiar look and feel
- The toolbar now includes more buttons, including rarity and leveling stones (that automatically change based on summoned pet and stones you have), a Load Random Pets button, and a pet satchel button to cycle through buttons in more compact views
- Tooltips now have an option for a delayed mouseover reaction speed (Slow, Normal, Fast) like pet cards and ability tooltips
- Throughout the UI, text in the dark blue "rare" color is a little bit brighter to make it easier to read against dark backgrounds
- Some options like Color Pet Names are now initially enabled on new installs
- Lists (pets, teams, targets, queue) can be separately made compact while other lists remain in their normal size
- Many options are converted to dropdowns

Standalone Window:
- The standalone window can now be expanded into three panels like the journal, while still collapsible down to two or one panels (or minimized)
- Tabs now align with the chosen anchor (eg. bottomright anchor will move tabs to bottomright) with an option to change them to an independent corner
- The standalone window can now be anchored to center top and center bottom in addition to the four corners

Interact Options:
- Targeting Options have been reworked as Interact Options with separate interact behaviors for target or mouseover of saved targets
- The Auto Load option is now in one of the On Target or On Mouseover
- If your Soft Interact is fully enabled, Rematch will offer an On Soft Interact option alongside On Target and On Mouseover

Pets:
- Pets can be marked and filtered with a "Pet Marker" similar to the target/world markers (skull, cross, star, etc.)
- From the filter menu, pet markers can be renamed to use for whatever purpose you want. Rename star to "Pets to Buy", skull to "Tier 1 Pets", etc.
- A list of filtered pets can be exported from the pet filter menu, optionally as a csv of their stats such as rarity, level and breed
- Pets can now be sorted by three levels of sort instead of one
- The number of teams a pet belongs to is now a sort option
- Compact pet lists are now styled more similarly to the normal-sized pet lists
- When you click the alert for a new pet you've learned, rather than search for all versions of the pet just learned, Rematch will scroll to the pet you've learned and show its pet card

Pet Cards:
- Pet cards are now minimizable for a more compact view of a pet's stats and abilities
- More options to "flip" a pet card over, including changing modifier key or requiring a click
- Background art for pet cards now include portrait, icon, pet type or no art in addition to expansion art
- Pets of the 350+ notable targets now display their rarity and stats on the pet card, with abilities adjusted for their stats
- Ability tooltips now have an option for background art of its icon or pet type

Teams:
- Teams can now contain multiple targets
- Teams are now organized into unlimited, scrollable, collapsable groups with up to 15 of them being shown as team tabs
- Teams and groups can be picked up onto the mouse and reorganized by drag and drop, much like pets in the queue
- In addition to drag and drop, a Team Herder tool from the Teams button allows easily moving many teams to other groups with simple clicks
- Team groups can be colored and teams within will inherit their color
- Leveling preferences and win records properties are now within the team edit dialog and not separate tooltips/dialogs
- When doing a backup of teams from the Teams button, details about the groups they belong to (icon, color, preferences and sort) are included and used when they're later imported

Random Pets:
- There is now a separate Random Pets Options to adjust how random pets are chosen
- Options about choosing a random pet in teams or based on health are now bundled into a new Random Pet Rules option: Strict, Normal or Lenient
- Random counter pets can be loaded for any of the 350+ known targets to randomly pick high-level pets that are Strong Vs and Tough Vs the target's pets (either with the toolbar button or by right-clicking the target in the target list)
- Counter teams will default to choosing pets that are Strong Vs and Tough Vs the opponent, with an option 'Pick Aggressive Counters' to pick random pets with the most Strong Vs abilities

Targets:
- Targets can now be assigned to multiple teams, with a priority order of teams you can reorder
- The target list is now in its own tab with targets colored by the expansion they're from
- When targeting something with more than one team, the target panel will display the topmost team with buttons to cycle through other teams
- When targeting wild pets, the target panel at the top will now display the pet for viewing its pet card and abilities before you battle
- Notable targets with known pets will always display their pets in the target panel in modes that always display the target panel
- Target models in the target panel are now displayed as their better-curated 2D portrait

Leveling Queue:
- A new Default Preferences in addition to Team and Group Preferences allows setting criteria regardless of the team loaded (such as a global max level for the queue)
- The queue now uses a stable sort by default so all things being equal, pets remain in the order they were added/moved during a sort
- Pets in a team can now be sorted to the top of the queue
- The leveling queue can now be exported and imported

Features Removed:
- Toolbar Option 'Move Toolbar To Bottom' was removed to make layouts easier to maintain
- Standalone Window Option 'Combine Pets And Queue' was removed to make layouts easier to maintain, and it's no longer needed with 3-panel option
- Preferred Window Mode option was removed and instead Rematch generally summons the last mode of the window. The Standalone Window Option 'Prefer Minimized Window' will make the standalone window summon minimized for many automatic behaviors
- Notes buttons besides pets in the battle UI are removed. I'd like to limit Rematch's interaction with the battle UI. That said, a team notes button will likely be added to the battle UI in a future update
- Rematch no longer tries to reproduce other addons' controls on the journal. If other addons' controls seem missing, try unchecking Rematch in the journal

Unreleased version 5.0.0-beta-22
- Added Standalone Window Option 'Prefer Minimized Window' to summon Rematch minimized when it's automatically shown (in response to an Interact Option, Safari Hat Reminder, etc.)

- The team right-click menu option Share -> Send will now show the dialog to send teams to other Rematch users. Note: Rematch 5 and Rematch 4 users can send teams to each other but if a Rematch 5 team has more than one target, only the first target will be picked up by Rematch 4 users

- Added Pet Filter Option 'Sort New Pets To Top' to temporarily sort new pets you've collected to the top of the pet list until Rematch is next closed or Reset All chosen from the pet filter menu
- When new pets are wrapped (from the store or promotion), they'll now properly sort to top of the list
- Rather than using a right-click menu to unwrap a pet, simply clicking the wrapped pet in the list will show its pet card (if not already shown) and unwrap the pet

- Restored Team Options 'Load Healthiest Pet' and its suboptions 'Allow Any Version' and 'After Battles Or Heals Too' (latter was previously 'After Pet Battles Too')
- Casting Revive Battle Pets or using a Battle Pet Bandage will potentially slot new pets from the leveling queue if the Leveling Queue Option 'Prefer Living Pets' is enabled and a leveling pet was skipped due to being dead or injured
- Interact Option 'Prefer Uninjured Teams' will check for 'Load Healthiest Pet' option also and choose the topmost team that can be loaded at full health
- When Interact Option 'Always Interact' is enabled and the loaded team is different than the current preferred team for the target (due to healing pets with 'Prefer Uninjured Teams' enabled or raising another team to top preferred team), interacting with the same target will re-trigger the chosen interact behavior, if any
- Loading a team with an invalid pet (caged, released, petID reassignment) will automatically find a replacement

Notes:

- The Auto Load and "Other" favorite filter import changes will not retroactively update settings already imported in prior beta versions. If you haven't made many changes in Rematch 5 you can "/rematch reset everything" to do a complete wipe and re-import, but this will wipe changes to all teams, groups and other settings since upgrading from Rematch 4 to the Rematch 5 beta.

- Added support for reverting back from upcoming Rematch 5 beta to Rematch 4. Note: Going from Rematch 5 back to Rematch 4 will return the addon to its pre-upgrade state. Changes made to teams, tabs/groups, queue, settings, etc. while using Rematch 5 will not carry back to Rematch 4.
- Added support for importing teams exported from Rematch 5 beta. Note: While Rematch 5 can store multiple targets in a team and multiple teams can share the same target, this is not possible in Rematch 4 (this verison). When importing teams from Rematch 5 into Rematch 4: If a team contains multiple targets, this version (Rematch 4) will only recognize the first target. If an existing team already has a target and you choose to make a copy on import into Rematch 4, the new team won't save with the target.

- Added option "Show Numeric Breeds" under Appearance Options for those that prefer the numeric breed.
- If both Battle Pet BreedID and PetTracker are enabled, added option "Use PetTracker Breeds" under Appearance Options to use the breeds from PetTracker instead of Battle Pet BreedID.

- During queue processing, whether a pet can level now uses the cached property of whether the pet can battle.
- While zoning, both roster and queue processing are paused.
- Other recent queue changes (such as all of 4.14.6) have been rolled back.

11/25/2022 version 4.14.8

- Fix for window appearing on screen when logging into combat with Keep Window On Screen -> Even Across Sessions enabled.
- Micronax moved to Legion expansion.

11/21/2022 version 4.14.7
- Changed event to trigger on pets loading from PET_JOURNAL_LIST_UPDATE to UPDATE_SUMMONPETS_ACTION.
- Added '/rematch queuedebug' slash command to monitor pets being deleted from the queue. Anyone who is experiencing their queue emptying: Run this command anytime after you log in and go about your business. If you get a popup that says Leveling Queue Pet Deleted! at the top, copy and paste its contents in a comment or PM to Gello at wowinterface or curse. The monitoring from this command ends on a logout/reload.

11/20/2022 version 4.14.6
- Pets are no longer automatically removed from the leveling queue when they are found missing or invalid - this includes when they are caged or released.
- When a leveling queue pet is missing or invalid (likely due to being caged or released), a "Missing or Invalid Pet" will be in the queue in its place.
- If the Missing or Invalid pet was due to being caged, released or a server-side petID reassignment, re-acquiring and adding the pet to the queue will leave the old Missing or Invalid Pet in the queue. (Rematch can't know it was the old one.)
- If the Missing or Invalid pet was due to pets becoming invalid for other reasons (pets being late to load on login), the pets should return to where they were when the pets are valid again.
- Right-click of a Missing or Invalid Pet in the queue will give an option to remove all of these missing pets from the queue if you choose.
- When the queue is sorted by levels (Active Sort or one-time sort in the Queue menu), Missing or Invalid Pets will sort to the bottom of the queue. Choosing Favorites First or Rares First will leave the Missing or Invalid Pets in their respective subsets.

11/15/2022 version 4.14.5

- Clicking a toolbar button and holding it down won't click it again on release.

07/23/2022 version 4.12.0
- Added Pet Card & Notes Option 'Notes Font Size' with options Small, Normal, Large to change the relative size of text in pet and team notes.
- If a pet has notes saved, a note button will appear beside its icon/portrait the top of the default Battle UI. As with elsewhere in the addon, mouseover of the button will display the notes and clicking the button will lock the notes in place.
- Added Pet Card & Notes Option 'Hide Notes Buttons In Battle UI' to hide the new notes buttons (in case they conflict with buttons/textures another addon puts there)
- Added the menu item "Set Notes" to the right-click menu of pets at the top of the default Battle UI, to summon/edit the notes for the pet.
- If a breed addon is enabled (like Battle Pet BreedID) then the import dialog will have a checkbox 'Prioritize Breed On Import' to match the best-fit breed (if one specified in import string) instead of level. This is the same setting that's been buried in options.
- If a breed addon is not enabled, then 'Prioritize Breed On Import' will not appear in options.

- Added a "help" text to the target list to describe green checkmarks if the option 'Hide Extra Help' is not checked.
- When both 'Compact List Mode' and 'Use Smaller Text Too' are checked, the options list uses smaller text too.
- Team lists slightly adjusted: target name font shrunk a tiny amount and team name allowed to wrap if user's font/scale allows.
- Fix for 'Hide Tooltip' option not working in Journal mode.

09/21/2020 version 4.11.2
- The Target button at the top of the loadout panel now pulls in a new target panel with a search box and a scrollable list of targets rather than the popout/context target menus. Clicking a target within the new panel will select that target.
- The target menus (still used in save dialogs) has been reworked to further group the 300+ notable targets by expansion.
- Added option 'Use Old Target Menu' under Targeting Options, for those who prefer the old context menu style over the new scrollable list of targets. This doesn't restore the old menu groupings - it restores the way the targets are chosen with the Target button.
- Added option 'Load Teams From Target Button' under Targeting Options, so that when a target with a saved team is chosen after clicking the Target button above your loaded pets, that saved team is loaded as it selects the target.

02/29/2020 version 4.10.2
- Added a "Quality" tab to the pullout "Type Bar" beneath the pet search box (alongside "Type", "Strong vs" and "Tough vs"), to quickly turn on filters for level 25 pets, rare pets, and to set the sort order to Health, Power or Speed.

- Added sub-option 'Show After Pet Battle' -> 'But Not After PVP Battle' in Miscellaneous Options, to prevent automatically showing the Rematch window after leaving a PVP battle.
- Added option 'Use Random If Queue Empty' in Leveling Queue Options, to load a random high level pet into leveling slots when the queue is empty rather than leaving the leveling slot alone.
- Attempted fix for sub-option 'Load Healthiest Pet' -> 'After Pet Battles Too' from not properly loading abilities when an alternate pet is found.
- Fix for SetPoint bug on 8.2 clients when moving the standalone frame.
- Fix for the Load button being incorrectly enabled in an empty import dialog.

05/18/2019 version 4.9.8
- The leveling queue should now survive server-side petID reassignments, rather than being wiped.
- Added new option in Team Options: Load Healthiest Pet -> "After Pet Battles Too" to replace pets with their healthiest version after a battle or revive/bandages used within Rematch. (Revive, bandages and stable masters outside Rematch will not be noticed and have no effect.)
- Added new option in Team Options: "Show Icons For Pets In Teams" to display an icon beside pets that belong to a team.
- Added a new option category "Team Win Record Options" and moved existing options to this new category.
- While loadout slots are locked (such as while queued for a pvp pet battle) in dual pane or journal views, pet cards will appear and can be locked into place and interacted with, but the underlying slots will otherwise remain uninteractable. There is no change in behavior for single panel or minimized views yet, sorry! This will come in a future update.

- Fix for potential scroll offset bug when pet list changes length.

03/22/2019 version 4.9.6

12/22/2018 version 4.9.2
- Reworked how breeds are pulled from supported addons in pet card, menus and filtering system. (If you have any saved filters that filter breed, you may need to update those filters.)
- Removed Breed.lua since it's no longer needed.
- If Preferred Window Mode is set to Pet Journal, then the Targeting Options to show the window will open the Pet Journal and not standalone. (Unless Use Default Pet Journal is checked - then the targeting options will open the standalone window.)

- In save dialogs, the text is changed from center-justified to left-justified to fix a weird cursor offset bug.

12/14/2018 version 4.9.1
- Updated toc to 8.1

12/11/2018 version 4.9.0
- The MacOS crash issue appears to be fixed. (If you're a Mac user with any Debug options enabled, feel free to turn them all off now.)
- The major lists in the addon (pets, teams, queue, options) have been reworked with a custom scrollframe (AutoScrollFrame) while keeping the same overall look.
- Changing the Appearance Option "Compact List Mode" no longer requires a reload - lists will immediately change between compact and normal views.
- New Miscellaneous Option "Slow Mousewheel Scroll" will cause mousewheel scrolling over the lists to scroll one line at a time instead of a whole page at a time.
- Clicking the up or down arrows near each end of the scrollbar will always scroll up or down one line at a time.
- Clicking above or below the scrollbar thumb will have a "pressed" visual and always scroll up or down one page at a time.
- At the top and bottom of the scrollbars are little buttons to go to the top and bottom of the lists.
- The elements in the lists now use a custom button (CompositeButton) that uses textures instead of other buttons for mouse events to reduce the number and layering of buttons and textures. (For instance, the number of team panel objects were reduced by 63% between 4.8.10 and 4.9.0.)
- The pet card will remain up when the mouse is over a pet's notes button or the icon of the pet itself (in the lists).
- The small pullout panel at the top of the Teams tab--to show the currently loaded team--has been removed. All views of the addon already show the loaded team that can be interacted with right-click.
- The small pullout panel at the top of the Queue tab--to show the current leveling pet--has been removed.
- Highlights of the pet currently showing the pet card is temporarily removed. (It will be back in a future update.)
- Right-clicking a pet in the team list will no longer have "Put Leveling Pet Here". Defining a leveling slot is now done only by right-clicking one of the slotted pets.
- The tiny floating numbers to toast win record changes has been removed.
- The "select" visual for summoned pets and loaded teams is now a border around the pet or team's name instead of their icons.
- Revoked pets (like Core Hound Pup with authenticator removed) have their icon colored red and name colored grey.
- Pet's that can't be summoned (like wrong-factioned Moonkin Hatchlings) have their icon and name colored grey.
- Pets that are revoked or can't be summoned now have a "Revoked" or "Can't Summon" stat on the pet card with tooltips to describe the state.
- The faction pets Lil' Siege Tower and Lil' War Machine will be dimmed and skipped in the leveling queue if you're playing the wrong faction and there are other available pets in the queue.
- Added new attributes to petInfo (usable in scripts): hasNotes, notes, isLeveling, and isSummoned.
- The text in the options list on German clients (deDE) will use a normal font size. (If this proves to be a problem let me know.)
- New files were added, so updating the addon while logged in with a /reload will warn that the addon is disabled until next login.

Known issues for 4.9.0:
- Rematch ElvUI Skin is not yet compatible with this update, sorry! That separate addon will need updated.
- Other addons that hook into Rematch may break with this update. (If you're an addon author, FillNewPetListButton replaces FillPetListButton - the code will be cleaned up later but I'll avoid changing names again to minimize breaking stuff.)
- When mousewheel scrolling over a pet icon in a list, you may see a semi-transparent icon of the first pet's icon floating over the new pet beneath the cursor. A more robust fix is in the works.
- If you'd prefer to go back to 4.8.10 due to these issues, 4.8.10 is compatible with the 8.1 client patch.

(Experimental changes from 4.8.9-experimental-01 to 06 that remained are are rolled into 4.9.0 changes listed above.)

- Renamed the option 'Debug: Delay Journal on Macs' to 'Debug: Delay Journal' for use on any client.

Special note for MacOS users experiencing crashes:
- The new Debug: No Models option is OFF by default.
- If you can't even bring up options, copy and paste the following to chat to turn on the option and reload the UI:
    /run RematchSettings.DebugNoModels=true ReloadUI()
- Changing this setting requires reloading the UI to take effect.

09/01/2018 version 4.8.5
- Fix for new Mac debug options not doing what they were intended: if Blizzard_Collections is already loaded on login, wait until the journal is actually shown to setup Rematch.

09/01/2018 version 4.8.4
- Changed 'Delay Journal On Macs' delay from half a second to a full second.

08/31/2018 version 4.8.3
- Added new debug option 'Delay Journal On Macs' that's enabled by default for MacOS clients. When the pet journal launches for the first time in a session, it will delay Rematch taking over the journal by half a second.
- Added new suboption to the above 'Delay Just One Frame' to make Rematch take over the journal almost instantly with the above option set. This option is disabled by default.
- Added Kul Tiras and Zandalar world quest tamers to the notable target choices.
- The three Argus target menus (Antorian Wastes, Krokuun and Mac'Aree) are now combined into one.

Special note for MacOS users experiencing crashes:
- The experimental settings 'Delay Journal On Macs' will hopefully prevent crashes. If it seems to work, try enabling 'Delay Just One Frame' too. Please let me know your findings.
- For those who use the standalone Rematch window: the above setting only relate to those who open Rematch in the pet journal. I understand the standalone window crashes too, but the new setting won't affect it.
- Thanks again for your patience!

08/08/2018 version 4.8.2
- Added a new options category 'Debugging Options'
- Moved option 'Debug: Journal FrameLevel' to this new category.
- Added option 'Debug: No Cache' to disable the automatic caching of NPC names.
- Added option 'Debug: No Sanctuary' to disable the system that protects against server petID reassignments.
- Teams are now checked for corruption on login, with instructions on what to do if any is encountered.
- While ElvUI and RematchElvUISkin are both enabled, the version of the latter will display at the end of options.

Special note for those experiencing crashes:
- If you're NOT on a MacOS client, let me know. So far crashes seem limited to MacOS.
- If you haven't, make a backup of WTF or Rematch's SavedVariable deep in WTF folder. Crashes are the #1 cause of addons losing data. (A backup of Interface\Addons\Rematch will not be useful. No saved data is stored there. Backup WTF instead.)
- If you're unsure how to backup WTF, and you can open the addon with /rematch, go to the Teams tab and choose 'Backup All Teams' from the Teams button at the top of the panel.
- Try to enable 'Debug: No Cache' and 'Debug: No Sanctuary' in the new 'Debugging Options' category and see if that helps.
- If you can't open Rematch to set those options, copy and paste this to chat to set those options and reload the UI:
/run RematchSettings.DebugNoCache=true RematchSettings.DebugNoSanctuary=true ReloadUI()
- Let me know if this solves the problem or not, or if you experience any other issues.
- Thank you for your patience!

- When exceeding 14 tabs, up/down buttons will appear above/below the tabs to scroll through them
- Mousewheel over the team tabs will also scroll through tabs while they're scrollable
- Added option 'Allow Random Pets From Teams' under Team Options. While this is enabled, random slots will choose from a pool of pets that includes pets saved in other teams. (The default behavior is to avoid slotting random pets from other teams so they're not pulled into service before you need them.)

01/31/2018 version 4.7.11
- Added option 'Use Level In Strong Vs Filter' under Pet Filter Options. This will limit the filter results to pets who are high enough level to use the abilities that are strong vs the chosen type.

11/12/2017 version 4.7.8
- To selectively hide pets in the pet list, the new option "Allow Hidden Pets" under the Pet Filter Options in the Options tab is now required. If you already have hidden pets, this option will be on by default. If you do not, it will be off by default. While this option is off, the various menu options related to hiding pets will be hidden.
- Added temporary option "Debug: Journal FrameLevel" under Miscellaneous Options, for an experimental fix for a few having problems opening Rematch in the Collections window.
- Fix for areas beneath notes being unclickable when there's more notes extending beyond the bottom.

09/30/2017 version 4.7.7
- Secondary accounts can once again run Rematch concurrently with the main account.

- Searches should now reliably be case-insensitive for deDE clients.

09/02/2017 version 4.7.6

- deDE localization updated by Salty from curse.com.
- zhCN localization updated by Yonshuo from curse.com.

07/11/2017 version 4.7.3

- Added new option to pet list right-click menu: 'Find Moveset' to find all pets that share the same moveset as the chosen pet.
- Added new pet filter: Other -> 'Unique Moveset' to filter the pet list to battle pets with movesets unique to their species.
- Added new pet filter: Other -> 'Shared Moveset' to filter the pet list to battle pets with movesets that other species also share.
- Added new option to Pet Filter Options in the Options tab: 'Hide Non-Battle Pets' to remove from the pet list companion pets that cannot battle.
- Elekk Plushie will no longer be chosen for a random pet.
- Added "On-Demand Table" system (ODTables) and moved pets in teams, pet sourceIDs, species at 25, and movesets to the new system.

Special note: Don't forget to occasionally backup your teams! Either the WTF folder or in-game from the Teams button menu -> Backup All Teams. An upcoming update will be changing the format teams are stored. It will be heavily tested and my hope is nobody notices any difference - but just in case!

06/26/2017 version 4.7.2
- When loaded ability numbers are enabled (Appearance Options->Show Ability Numbers->On Loaded Abilities Too) they will appear in the minimized view also.
- Fix for leveling icon glitch in compact list format.

- ruRU localization updated by Gizmi on curse.com.

06/20/2017 version 4.7.1
- Random slots will prefer pets not in a team and at full health. Injured pets will have a higher priority than dead pets.
- If all three slots in a team are random, it will disregard whether the random pet is in a team, but health preference still applies. This allows loading a team of totally random (healthy) pets.
- If no chosen random pet type is available when a team loads, and 'Don't Warn About Missing Pets' is not checked in Confirmation Options, a missing pet dialog will appear.
- Added option 'Randomize Abilities Too' under Team Options, to randomize the abilities of random pets.
- Added inTeams and numTeams to petInfo (usable in script filters).

- Added two new slot types: Ignored and Random.
- Ignored slots will be left alone when a team loads.
- Random slots will load a random high level/rarity pet of any type or a single type if chosen.
- To mark a slot as Ignored or Random, right-click the loaded slot and choose 'Ignore This Slot' or 'Put Random Pet Here'.
- Gold borders around loaded pets now means the slot is either Leveling, Ignored or Random slots, not just Leveling.
- A small button will appear in the corner of the slot's pet to show what type of special slot it is.
- The menu for loaded pets was simplified to shorten them and remove ambiguity of whether to stop leveling the slot or the pet in the slot.
- Teams exported or sent will share the random or ignored slots, but only Rematch versions 4.7 or greater will recognize these special slots on import or receive.
- Patch 7.2.5's Deadmines targets added to the Target menus.
- Cleaned up a couple potential unintentional globals.

- Added new option 'Share In Legacy Format' under Team Options in the Options tab, to export and send teams in the old format.

- Share option 'Export As Plain Text' changed to 'Copy As Plain Text'.
- Share option 'Export As String' changed to 'Export Team'.
- Added a petInfo table to the script filter system, for additional pet information such as possible breeds. See Process\PetInfo.lua.

Special note on compatability:
- All teams ever exported by Rematch in the string format can still be imported, even teams exported in 2013.
- However, from this version forward, all new exported and sent teams will not be recognized by earlier versions of the addon unless 'Share In Legacy Format' is enabled.

05/26/2017 version 4.6.7

03/30/2017 version 4.6.4
- Removed debug print during mouseover of opponent pets during battle

03/28/2017 version 4.6.3

- Added two new queue sort options to the Queue button's menu: Favorites First and Rares First. These will group favorites and/or rares to the top of the queue. If Active Sort is enabled alongside either option they will always be sorted to the top - otherwise it is a one-time sort like the rest.
- The "Type" queue sort order has been removed.
- Menu check and radio buttons now use a higher-resolution texture. (Note: If you see neon green squares in menus, it likely means you updated while logged into the game. The green squares will turn into checkboxes and radio buttons when you next start WoW.)

- When leaving battle, if the notes editbox has focus, the window will stay up and not close.

08/10/2016 version 4.5.0
- Leveling queue revamp:
  - The queue's control of a slot is now defined by the slot itself and no longer the pet within the slot.
  - Slotting the top-most queued pet will no longer designate a slot as a leveling slot - manually designating a leveling slot will only be from the right-click menu "Put Leveling Pet Here".

  - You can now mark a slot as a leveling slot even if there are no pets in the queue.
  - The queue can now be manipulated during battle, pvp or combat. If any pet needs swapped due to changes in the queue it will wait to swap when leaving battle, pvp or combat.
  - The "Save Without Leveling Slots" option in the save dialog is now redundant and has been removed.
  - Added a Help menu item to the queue menu to describe how to use the queue.

07/23/2016 version 4.4.9
- Removed beta-specific code that made the addon work on both live and beta clients.
- When loading a team, only valid ability combinations will now load. For instance Pandaren Water Spirit's Geyser and Whirlpool now share the third ability slot. Old saved teams will no longer load Whirlpool in the second slot.

- This version supports both the WoD(live) and Legion(beta) clients.
Changes for both WoD(live) and Legion(beta):

- Fix for various cosmetic issues for users with less than three battle pet slots unlocked.
Changes for Legion(beta):
- The Legion client has major bugs with moving scrollframes between the pet journal and standalone frame. Until this is fixed, you can only choose whether to use Rematch as a standalone window OR integrated with the journal. NOT both. The choice is decided by the Preferred Window Mode in the Options tab. Choosing a new Preferred Window Mode will confirm the choice and then Reload the UI.
- Fix for inability to choose an icon for a new team tab.

- Fix for pet count tooltip not attached to the pet count button.

04/29/2016 version 4.3.5
- Added option "Use Pet Cards In Battle" under Pet Card & Notes Options to use a pet card in place of the default tooltip on pet unit frames during a battle.
- Added option "Use Pet Cards For Links" under Pet Card & Notes Options to replace the default pet link with the pet card.

- On the pet card for pets in the team list, the "search hit" gold border is removed for abilities used by the pet and abilities not used are greyed out instead.

04/01/2016 version 4.3.0
- New "Win Record" system to track the success of your teams by manually or automatically recording how often they win.
  - To manually add a win, loss or draw to a team that doesn't have a win record, right-click the team and "Edit Win Record".
  - Once a team has a win record a button appears to the right of the team that says how often that team has won.
    - Mouseover of the button will display a card-like window with details about the team's win record.
    - Clicking this button will allow you to increment or edit one of its win record stats.
  - If you prefer Rematch to track your wins automatically, turn on "Auto Track Win Record" under Team Options in the Options tab.
    - During auto tracking, a win or loss is incremented for the loaded team at the end of each battle.
    - Your forfeits are always counted as a loss - your opponent's forfeits are always counted as a win for you.
    - The game does not recognize a draw. If you and your opponent's last pet dies on the same round, it will be counted as a loss.
    - You can still manually edit a team while auto tracking is enabled.
  - There are a couple options to change how win records are displayed, whether to display total wins instead of percent wins or whether to hide all win records, in the Options tab under Team Options.
  - Each team tab now has "Sort By Wins" in its right-click menu. This will sort the teams within the tab by their win rate.
  - The win record "card" will obey the Pet Cards & Notes options "Faster Pet Cards & Notes" and "Click For Pet Cards & Notes".
  - For those who have already named their teams to include win-loss(-draw): "/rematch winrecord convert" will attempt to pull those numbers into the new win record system and automatically rename the existing teams.
- New menu item "Backup All Teams" added to the Teams menu, to export all teams into text that you can save elsewhere to import when needed. (Right now this backup does not include breeds or win records. That will be added in a future update.)
- Some disabled menu items will now give a reason why they're disabled in a tooltip.
- The quarter-second delay before a pet card or note displays has been added to ability cards, which can be turned off with "Faster Pet Cards & Notes" under the Pet Cards & Notes options.
- The pet card of a pet in the team list will mark the abilities that the pet uses in that team.

03/06/2016 version 4.2.0
- Many internal changes to better organize and optimize behind-the-scenes stuff. In general:
  - The way pets are cataloged and managed has been reworked to be "on demand". It will not spend time or memory caring about what pets you own until you summon the Rematch window or it otherwise needs to know what pets you own.
  - The pet filtering process has been reworked to be more efficient. Instead of checking each filter for every pet, it will only check active filters. Reusable tables are more intelligently reused. And key parts are better optimized for speed.
  - The system to handle petIDs changing (whether due to a wholesale server petID reassignment or to a caged and relearned pet) has been reworked for reliability and to reduce the time spent monitoring changes in your pets.
  - The process of updating the internal data and updating the UI to reflect that data was made more internally consistent across the addon.
- When loading a target from the target panel before reaching that target, auto load will not reload the team, removing any changes you made while on the way to that target.
- When the mouse is over a team in the team list, it will highlight the tab its from.
- When "Fill Queue More" is used multiple times, each attempt will grab a qualifying pet from each species regardless of whether any are already queued or at 25.
- Added support for patch 6.2.4 battle.net changes.
- Fix for "Fill Queue" sometimes behaving like "Fill Queue More".
- Fix for "Keep On Screen" sub-option "Even Across Sessions" being active even when Keep On Screen disabled.
- Fix for multiple pets learned very quickly not being recognized.

02/10/2016 version 4.1.10

- Pet searches in "quotes" will now limit results to only the complete matches. "Rat" will list only the pets named Rat instead of everything with the letters r-a-t - "Dodge" will list only pets with the Dodge ability without listing all pets that affect dodge chance - etc.
- Added right-click menu to abilities on the pet card and loadout slots to "Find Pets With This Ability".
- Ability searches by the old double click or the new menu will use quotes to limit to just those abilities.

01/25/2016 version 4.1.8

- Made the pet type textures in pet/queue normal lists a little brighter so they're easier to see.
- Changed pet card ability type textures to a style similar to pet lists.

01/15/2016 version 4.1.7
- Korean (koKR) localization by IrisNib from curse.com.
- The code for the arrangement of the standalone window has been rewritten.
- Toolbar and panel buttons reworked:
  - In the single panel view, the window now defaults to using the red panel buttons (Save/Save As/Find Battle) across the bottom, and the toolbar buttons are moved to the top. This is to make the journal, dual panel and single panel views consistent.
  - The order of toolbar buttons are slightly rearranged to be in a consistent order across all views. Default from left to right: Revive Battle Pets, Battle Pet Bandage, Safari Hat, Lesser Pet Treat, Pet Treat, Summon Random Pet, Save, Save As and Find Battle.
  - Added option "Move Toolbar To Bottom" in new option category "Toolbar Options" to move the toolbar to the bottom of single panel and dual panel views.
  - The "Reverse Toolbar Buttons" option is moved to "Toolbar Options" and will reverse the order of all buttons instead of some.
  - To minimize the impact of the above changes to existing users, when an existing user logs in to the update, a one-time check will see if they have Single Panel Mode active.  If so, "Move Toolbar To Bottom" will be automatically checked and "Reverse Toolbar Buttons" will be reversed.
  - The little "Pet Count" window in the journal and dual panel view is also being added to the toolbar in single panel view when space permits.
  - Cooldown spinners added to Safari Hat, Battle Pet Bandage, and Summon Random Pet buttons.

01/04/2016 version 4.1.6
- Chinese (zhTW) localization by gaspy10 from curse.com.
- Clicking a treat button while its buff is active will warn that the buff is already up and abort the cast. (Casting a treat while a buff is active would not increase its duration.)
- When logging in with a treat buff active from a previous session, its cooldown spinner will reflect the remaining time since you logged in. (This is a temporary workaround until the cooldown bug is fixed on Blizzard's end.)
- Fix for bug with script filter iterator function AllAbilities causing abilities to be misread (most notably causing non-unique pets to list with Unique Pets script filter).
- Fix for lua error when breed filtering encounters a "New" breed via Battle Pet Breed ID.

01/01/2016 version 4.1.5

- Removed option "Smaller Standalone Window" under Standalone Window Options. Anyone with this setting will automatically have Use Custom Scale enabled with a scale of 80%.

  - You can mousewheel to scroll up/down the notes if they extend beyond the viewable area.
 - Teams with notes will have an icon beside their name in the team list. These notes can be viewed several ways:
  - When the mouse is over the notes icon in the team list.

- On the "pet card"/tooltip, when the mouse is over any part of the title area--instead of one of its icons--it will flip the card to the back.
- On the pet card, if you have any level 25 versions of the pet you're looking at, the color of the pennant behind the level will be gold.
- When a dialog appears, all but the current pets area will darken slightly and become uninteractive to prevent weird interactions with dialogs.
- Mouseover of pet totals at bottom of the browser will display more totals: number of pets you own, number of pets you're missing, unique pets you own and level 25 pets.
- When saving a team, if you change the name from the one provided, the team will save with no npc ID.
