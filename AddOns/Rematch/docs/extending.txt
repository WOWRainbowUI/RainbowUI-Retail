There are a few ways for outside addons to extend Rematch.

Please be kind and don't make any changes to Rematch's saved variables. All effects of your addon to Rematch (noticable or not)
should disappear if your addon is disabled.

__ Events __

Rematch uses an event dispatch system that outside addons can use:

    Event                   Argument         When
    REMATCH_UI_CONFIGURE      (none)           After the main Rematch window has changed configuration (minimized, panel changes, etc) or shows
    REMATCH_UI_RESIZE         (none)           After the main Rematch window has resized
    REMATCH_UI_UPDATE         (none)           After the main Rematch window has finished a global update of all shown panels
    REMATCH_TEAM_LOADED       teamID           A team is loaded or unloaded (can be nil for a team unloaded)
    REMATCH_TEAM_CREATED      teamID           After a new teamID is created
    REMATCH_TEAM_DELETED      teamID           After a teamID is deleted
    REMATCH_TEAM_UPDATED      teamID           After a teamID is changed (can be due to being overwritten by another team)
    REMATCH_TEAM_OVERWRITTEN  teamID,oldTeamID Just before teamID is overwritten by oldTeamID (can be nil for import/received teams)
    REMATCH_TEAMS_CHANGED     (none)           After any teams changed (happens after other REMATCH_TEAM events and before UI is updated)
    REMATCH_TEAMS_CONVERTED   table            After Rematch 4 teams converted to Rematch 5 (see savedvars/convert.lua)
    REMATCH_TEAMS_READY       (none)           After login when teams are settled
    REMATCH_TEAMS_WIPED       (none)           After all teams are wiped by /rematch delete all teams
    REMATCH_PETS_LOADED       (none)           After login and pets are believed to be loaded
    REMATCH_PETS_CHANGED      (none)           After the pet roster has changed

To register for these events:

    Rematch.events:Register(frame,"EVENT_NAME",callbackFunction)

Example:

    local frame = CreateFrame("Frame") -- your frame, anything really
    Rematch.events:Register(frame,"REMATCH_TEAM_LOADED",function(self,teamID)
        local team = Rematch.savedTeams[teamID]
        if team then
            print("Team",team.name,"just loaded")
        end
    end)

Notes:
    - A REMATCH_UI_CONFIGURE will usually be followed by a REMATCH_UI_RESIZE and then REMATCH_UI_UPDATE
    - A REMATCH_UI_RESIZE will usually be followed by a REMATCH_UI_UPDATE
    - If you want to capture all configure/resize, you can just register for REMATCH_UI_UPDATE
    - If you call Rematch.frame:Update() it will trigger a REMATCH_UI_UPDATE (careful to not get in a circular loop)
    - On REMATCH_TEAM_OVERWRITTEN, when teams are imported and user choses to overwrite existing teams, the oldTeamID
      will be nil. Generally the oldTeamID is not nil when a single team is edited or Save As over an existing one

__ Teams __

Teams are ultimately saved in Rematch5SavedTeams but I recommend not dealing with this table directly. Instead, use
Rematch.savedTeams[teamID] instead, where teamID is something like "team:123" a unique identifier for a team.

This is for getting information about teams. Please don't change them. If a team is broken, I will get blamed for it being
broken and have no way of knowing what caused it or how to fix it. For instance, even disabling all other addons the team
will still be broken so it would seem Rematch has the problem. Also, if a team changes in a way that the whole addon is
broken, I would get blamed (disabling all other addons won't fix it) and have no idea of the cause or that the likely only
fix is a total wipe of all teams.

As an alternative to storing data in these teams, I recommend making your own savedvar indexed by teamID and watching
for changes from the REMATCH_TEAM_CREATED/DELETED/UPDATED events above. Let me know if other events or methods are needed.

For getting information about a teamID, a saved team has this format:

    rematch.savedTeams[teamID] = {
        teamID = "team:0", -- unique identifier of the team (required and persistent)
        name = "", -- unique name of the team (required, case insensitive)
        pets = {petID,petID,petID}, -- list of petIDs (or speciesIDs/"leveling"/"random:0"/"ignored") (required)
        tags = {petTag,petTag,petTag}, -- list of petTags of petIDs (required; see process/petTags for structure)
        [favorite = true,] -- whether team is favorited
        [groupID = "group:0",] -- group for team (defaults to group:none)
        [homeID = "group:0",] -- groupID the team belongs to when it's not favorited (or potential future group)
        [notes = "",] -- notes for team
        [targets = {targetID,targetID,targetID,...},] -- ordered list of targets (npcIDs)
        [preferences = {minHP=0,maxHP=0,minXP=0,maxXP=0,allowMM=true,expectedDD=0},]
        [winrecord = {wins=0,losses=0,draws=0,battles=0},]
    }

To iterate over all teamIDs:

    for teamID,team in Rematch.savedTeams:AllTeams() do
        print(team.name,"is teamID",teamID)
    end


__ Loaded Team __

The currently-loaded teamID is Rematch.settings.currentTeamID. Just after this value changes, a REMATCH_TEAM_LOADED
event will fire. If the currentTeamID or the teamID passed in the event is nil, it means a team was unloaded.

Sometimes a team can be loaded that's not a saved team. These teamIDs include (but are not limited to):

    "loadonly"  When a team is imported without saving with the "Load" button on the import dialog
    "counter"   Random teams from the Load Random Team button (for a known targetID it will load counter pets/abilities)

To tell if a teamID is a saved team, you can use:

    local isSavedTeam = Rematch.savedTeams:IsUserTeam(teamID)


__ PetInfo __

Rematch makes extensive use of a petInfo system to minimize API calls when multiple functions are getting information
about the same pet.

As a rule, you Rematch.petInfo:Fetch(petID) to make a petID a pet of interest, and then get properties of the petInfo.
When you fetch the same petID, it will use the cached results.

For instance:

    local petID = C_PetJournal.GetSummonedPetGUID()
    local petInfo = Rematch.petInfo:Fetch(petID)
    print("Summoned pet:",petInfo.isOwned and petInfo.name or "None")

petInfo.isOwned says whether this is a pet you own. There are over 70 properties to a petInfo.

A petID can be a BattlePet-0-etc GUID, or a numeric speciesID, or a variety of other IDs:

    idType      example petID value    description
    ----------  ---------------------  -----------------------------------
    "pet"       "Battle-0-0000000etc"  a player-owned pet in the journal
    "species"   42                     speciesID species number
    "leveling"  0                      leveling slot
    "ignored"   "ignored"              ignored slot
    "link"      "battlepet:42:25:etc"  linked pet
    "battle"    "battle:2:1"           pet in battle (battle:owner:index)
    "random"    "random:10"            random mechanical pet (random:0 for any pet type)
    "unnotable" "unnotable:npcID"      pet of a target not in targetData's notableTargets
    "empty"     nil or "blank"         no pet
    "unknown"   (anything else)        indecipherable/undefined pet

See info\petInfo.lua for more details


__ Adding Badges __

Badges are small icons on the right of list buttons, to show if a pet is leveling, if a team has preferences, etc.

At the moment, the Notes button is the only badge that can be clicked to do something. Support for custom clickable
badges may come in the future.

To add badge support:

    Rematch.badges:RegisterBadge(list,badge,icon,iconCoords,callback)

With these arguments:
    list        Either "pets", "teams" or "targets" to choose which list to add to
    badge       An arbitrary unique name for the badge
    icon        A filepath/fileID for the icon to use with the badge
    iconCoords  Optional texcoords for the icon an ordered table {left,right,top,bottom} can be nil
    callback    A function that takes a petID, teamID or targetID and returns true if badge should show

This example creates a "cats" badge that puts a badge on pets with 'Cat' in their species name:

    -- callback function to return whether the badge should be shown
    local function isCat(petID)
        local petInfo = Rematch.petInfo:Fetch(petID)
        if petInfo.speciesName and petInfo.speciesName:match("Cat") then
            return true
        end
    end

    -- register "cats" badge
    Rematch.badges:RegisterBadge("pets","cats","Interface\\Icons\\Ability_Druid_CatForm",{0.075,0.925,0.075,0.925},isCat)
    -- update Rematch UI if it's on screen (if it's not on screen it will be updated when it's shown) to show badges
    if Rematch.frame:IsVisible() then
        Rematch.frame:Update()
    end

This example adds a black tabby cat badge to every team that has a black tabby cat:

    -- callback function to return whether teamID has a black tabby cat
    local function hasBlackTabby(teamID)
        for _,petID in ipairs(Rematch.savedTeams[teamID].pets) do
            local petInfo = Rematch.petInfo:Fetch(petID)
            if petInfo.speciesID==42 then
                return true
            end
        end
    end

    -- register "tabby" badge
    Rematch.badges:RegisterBadge("teams","tabby","Interface\\Icons\\INV_Pet_Cats_BlackTabbyCat",{0.075,0.925,0.075,0.925},hasBlackTabby)
    -- update Rematch UI if it's on screen (if it's not on screen it will be updated when it's shown) to show badges
    if Rematch.frame:IsVisible() then
        Rematch.frame:Update()
    end

Note: Rematch.frame:Update() is only needed when the Rematch UI is on screen and something changes that should update badges.
When the addon is summoned or various other things (pets learned, teams saved, etc.) the UI will update badges automatically.

__ Adding to Menus __

Menus are built from an ordered list of subtables that define each menu item. For instance this is TeamMenu from menus/teamMenu.lua:

    -- menu when you right-click a team in the team list
    local teamMenu = {
        {title=tm.GetTeamName},
        {text=L["Unload Team"], hidden=tm.IsTeamNotLoaded, func=tm.UnloadTeam},
        {text=L["Edit Team"], func=tm.EditTeam},
        {text=L["Set Notes"], func=tm.SetNotes},
        {text=L["Move Team"], func=tm.MoveTeam},
        {text=L["Load Saved Target"], hidden=tm.NoSavedTarget, func=tm.LoadSavedTarget },
        {text=tm.SetOrRemoveFavoriteText, func=tm.SetOrRemoveFavorite},
        {text=L["Share"], subMenu="ShareTeamMenu"},
        {text=L["Delete Team"], func=tm.DeleteTeam},
        {text=CANCEL},
    }
    rematch.menus:Register("TeamMenu",teamMenu)

It has a name "TeamMenu" that's used to show/reference the menu, and each item has properties, many of which can be a literal value
or a function that returns it's value when the menu is shown.

Note that even the text property can be a function. The function tm.SetOrRemoveFavoriteText is:

    function rematch.teamMenu:SetOrRemoveFavoriteText(teamID)
        local team = teamID and rematch.savedTeams[teamID]
        return (team and team.favorite) and L["Remove Favorite"] or L["Set Favorite"]
    end

The argments passed to these functions are dependent on the menu's context. For team menus they'll pass a teamID,
for pet menus they'll pass a petID, etc.

To add to one of these menus, use:

    Rematch.menus:AddToMenu(menuName,menuItem,afterText)

Where menuName is the name of the menu ("TeamMenu" in example above), menuItem is a single menu item table, and afterText
is the text property the new menu item should be placed after. If afterText is nil, then it will be placed at the start of
the menu. If placing it aftter a text that's a function (like SetOrRemoveFavoriteText above) then use the function as
the afterText.

In the function called from the func property of the menuItem, the first argument is the menuItem itself, and the second
(or further) is the context-specific subject.

For instance:

    local function printTeamID(self,teamID)
    print("This is",teamID,"var is",self.var)
    end

    local menuItem = {text="Print TeamID", var=123, func=printTeamID}

    Rematch.menus:AddToMenu("TeamMenu",menuItem)

Note: While many properties can be a literal or a function, custom properties of a menuItem (like var above) are
treated as a literal always.


__ Pet Cards __

Any button can show a pet card by setting up an OnEnter, OnLeave and OnClick like below.

Assuming 'self' is a reference to the button and button.petID contains the petID to show:

    Rematch.cardManager:OnEnter(Rematch.petCard,self,self.petID)
    Rematch.cardManager:OnLeave(Rematch.petCard,self,self.petID)
    Rematch.cardManager:OnClick(Rematch.petCard,self,self.petID)

The petID can be a full BattlePet-0-etc, or a speciesID like 42, a "link" like "battlepet:1339:25:5:2631:750:206",
or "battle:2:1" for the enemy's first pet in battle, etc. See info/petInfo.lua for more about possible petIDs.


__ Adding a Tab __

Other addons can add their own tabs to Rematch with related panels shown when going to that tab, though there is not enough
space for more tabs in the minimized and single-panel views. New tabs get added to the right of Options when space permits.

More details is in layout/definitions.lua, but here is a basic example:

    -- create a frame with Rematch.frame as its parent
    local f = CreateFrame("Frame",nil,Rematch.frame,"RematchPanelInsetFrameTemplate")
    f.hello = f:CreateFontString(nil,"ARTWORK","GameFontNormalHuge")
    f.hello:SetAllPoints(true)
    f.hello:SetText("Hello, TestPanel")

    -- and make sure it has a parentKey to Rematch.frame
    Rematch.frame.TestPanel = f -- set parentKey to Rematch.frame from above

    -- set up definitions for the modes (0=minimized, 1=single panel, 2=dual panel, 3=triple panel)
    local definitions = {
        { -- add TestPanel to 3-panel modes
            mode = 3, view = "test", width = 844, height = 520, tab = "Test",
            panels = {
            {"TeamsPanel","TOPLEFT","Canvas","TOPRIGHT",-280,0,"BOTTOMRIGHT","Canvas","BOTTOMRIGHT",0,0},
            {"TestPanel","TOPLEFT","Canvas","TOPLEFT",0,0,"BOTTOMRIGHT","TeamsPanel","BOTTOMLEFT",-2,0}
            }
        },
        { -- add TestPanel to 2-panel modes
            mode = 2, view = "test", width = 562, height = 520, tab = "Test",
            panels = {
            {"TeamsPanel","TOPLEFT","Canvas","TOPRIGHT",-280,0,"BOTTOMRIGHT","Canvas","BOTTOMRIGHT",0,0},
            {"TestPanel","TOPLEFT","Canvas","TOPLEFT",0,0,"BOTTOMRIGHT","TeamsPanel","BOTTOMLEFT",0,0}
            }
        },
        { -- the tab won't be visible for single panel mode but this makes it visible in single panel
            mode = 1, view = "test", width = 340, height = 520, tab = "Test",
            panels = {
            {"TestPanel","TOPLEFT","Canvas","TOPLEFT",0,0,"BOTTOMRIGHT","Canvas","BOTTOMRIGHT",0,0}
            }
        }
    }

    -- register layout definitions
    for _,def in pairs(definitions) do
        Rematch.layout:Register(def)
    end
