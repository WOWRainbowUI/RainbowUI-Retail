# <DBM Mod> Raids (Legion)

## [r61](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Legion/tree/r61) (2025-10-25)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Legion/compare/r60...r61) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Legion/releases)

- Refine all tank stacks checks to be disabled when overpowering emerald nightmare, nighthold, and trial of valor such as legion remix or overleveling outside of remix.  
    Running legion modules still have their place for seeing quickest kills, pull stats and other stuff but most naggy type directive alerts have no place in trivial content.  
- Add rp timer for door opening in hallway before anomaly in nighthold
