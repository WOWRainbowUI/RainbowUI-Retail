[Full Changelog](https://github.com/TheMouseNest/Auctionator/compare/311...312) 

- Retail: Fix item level matching failing (causing 0 results to show)  
    Note: Favourites you \_do not\_ have in your bags will not do item level  
    matching properly, this is a limitation of the APIs from Blizzard
